In your web browser, visit http://localhost:3000/blocking and as it loads, quickly reload the http://localhost:3000/non-blocking tabs. As you will notice, the non-blocking routes are still affected and they will all wait for the /blocking route to finish loading. Because the routes are still affected, promises donâ€™t make JavaScript code execute in parallel and cannot be used to make CPU-bound tasks non-blocking.
